Description: Everyday lots of invoices are generated and keeping the record like invoice numbers, buyer details like contact, email, address and other important context-based information is very necessary in todayâ€™s data driven world.

When we have quite advanced on data driven decision making and everybody use the phrases like data is the new oil, data is the new gas etc., it is utmost important to analyze every kind of data to do descriptive, prescriptive and predictive analysis and take the business ahead.

That is where there is a need in finance domain as well to analyze the invoice data. However, the challenge here is that those invoices are not in the standard formats and extracting specific contextual information is very challenging.

Solution Proposed: A Gen AI based invoice extractor having two components: 
Prompt
Large Language Model (LLM)
Prompt has metadata templates like Invoice Schema, Address Schema, Product Schema, Bill Schema and LLM accepts this prompt with raw text extracted from pdfs and generate required metadata.

Solution: US-Design
